<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>ABCI++ is a major evolution of ABCI (<strong>A</strong>pplication <strong>B</strong>lock<strong>c</strong>hain <strong>I</strong>nterface).
Like its predecessor, ABCI++ is the interface between CometBFT (a state-machine
replication engine) and the actual state machine being replicated (i.e., the Application).
The API consists of a set of <em>methods</em>, each with a corresponding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Request</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Response</code>
message type.</p>

<p>The methods are always initiated by CometBFT. The Application implements its logic
for handling all ABCI++ methods.
Thus, CometBFT always sends the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Request*</code> messages and receives the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Response*</code> messages
in return.</p>

<p>All ABCI++ messages and methods are defined in <a href="../../proto/tendermint/abci/types.proto">protocol buffers</a>.
This allows CometBFT to run with applications written in many programming languages.</p>

<p>This specification is split as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/v0.34/spec/abci/abci++_basic_concepts/">Overview and basic concepts</a> - interfaceâ€™s overview and concepts
needed to understand other parts of this specification.</li>
  <li><a href="/v0.34/spec/abci/abci++_methods/">Methods</a> - complete details on all ABCI++ methods
and message types.</li>
  <li><a href="/v0.34/spec/abci/abci++_app_requirements/">Requirements for the Application</a> - formal requirements
on the Applicationâ€™s logic to ensure CometBFT properties such as liveness. These requirements define what
CometBFT expects from the Application; second part on managing ABCI application state and related topics.</li>
  <li><a href="/v0.34/spec/abci/abci++_tmint_expected_behavior/">CometBFTâ€™s expected behavior</a> - specification of
how the different ABCI++ methods may be called by CometBFT. This explains what the Application
is to expect from CometBFT.</li>
  <li><a href="/v0.34/spec/abci/abci++_client_server/">Client and Server</a> - for those looking to implement their
own ABCI application servers</li>
</ul>
