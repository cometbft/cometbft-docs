<p>Light clients are an important part of the complete blockchain system for most
applications. Tendermint provides unique speed and security properties for
light client applications.</p>

<p>See our <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tendermint/tendermint/light?tab=doc">light
package</a>.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>The objective of the light client protocol is to get a commit for a recent
block hash where the commit includes a majority of signatures from the last
known validator set. From there, all the application state is verifiable with
<a href="https://github.com/tendermint/spec/blob/953523c3cb99fdb8c8f7a2d21e3a99094279e9de/spec/blockchain/encoding.md#iavl-tree">merkle proofs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You get the full collateralized security benefits of Tendermint; no
need to wait for confirmations.</li>
  <li>You get the full speed benefits of Tendermint; transactions
commit instantly.</li>
  <li>You can get the most recent version of the application state
non-interactively (without committing anything to the blockchain). For
example, this means that you can get the most recent value of a name from the
name-registry without worrying about fork censorship attacks, without posting
a commit and waiting for confirmations. Itâ€™s fast, secure, and free!</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tendermint/tendermint/light?tab=doc#TrustOptions">Trust Options</a></p>

<p>One way to obtain semi-trusted hash &amp; height is to query multiple full nodes
and compare their hashes:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>curl <span class="nt">-s</span> https://233.123.0.140:26657:26657/commit | jq <span class="s2">"{height: .result.signed_header.header.height, hash: .result.signed_header.commit.block_id.hash}"</span>
<span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="s2">"height"</span>: <span class="s2">"273"</span>,
  <span class="s2">"hash"</span>: <span class="s2">"188F4F36CBCD2C91B57509BBF231C777E79B52EE3E0D90D06B1A25EB16E6E23D"</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="running-a-light-client-as-an-http-proxy-server">Running a light client as an HTTP proxy server</h2>

<p>Tendermint comes with a built-in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tendermint light</code> command, which can be used
to run a light client proxy server, verifying Tendermint RPC. All calls that
can be tracked back to a block header by a proof will be verified before
passing them back to the caller. Other than that, it will present the same
interface as a full Tendermint node.</p>

<p>You can start the light client proxy server by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tendermint light &lt;chainID&gt;</code>,
with a variety of flags to specify the primary node,  the witness nodes (which cross-check
the information provided by the primary), the hash and height of the trusted header,
and more.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>tendermint light supernova <span class="nt">-p</span> tcp://233.123.0.140:26657 <span class="se">\</span>
  <span class="nt">-w</span> tcp://179.63.29.15:26657,tcp://144.165.223.135:26657 <span class="se">\</span>
  <span class="nt">--height</span><span class="o">=</span>10 <span class="nt">--hash</span><span class="o">=</span>37E9A6DD3FA25E83B22C18835401E8E56088D0D7ABC6FD99FCDC920DD76C1C57
</code></pre></div></div>
