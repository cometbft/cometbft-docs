<p>Welcome to the Tendermint Core documentation!</p>

<p>Tendermint Core is a blockchain application platform; it provides the equivalent
of a web-server, database, and supporting libraries for blockchain applications
written in any programming language. Like a web-server serving web applications,
Tendermint serves blockchain applications.</p>

<p>More formally, Tendermint Core performs Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)
State Machine Replication (SMR) for arbitrary deterministic, finite state machines.
