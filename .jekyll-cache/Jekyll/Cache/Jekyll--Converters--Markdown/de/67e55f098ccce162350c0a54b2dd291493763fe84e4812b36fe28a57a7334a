<p>The Tendermint consensus engine records all agreements by a
supermajority of nodes into a blockchain, which is replicated among all
nodes. This blockchain is accessible via various RPC endpoints, mainly
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/block?height=</code> to get the full block, as well as
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/blockchain?minHeight=_&amp;maxHeight=_</code> to get a list of headers. But what
exactly is stored in these blocks?</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/spec/core/data_structures.md">specification</a> contains a detailed description of each component - thatâ€™s the best place to get started.</p>
